## What is a tree?
Trees are data structures where a parent node can have 0 or more children nodes. They are usually used for implementing dictionaries or to represent hierachies.

## Tree Vocab
* Root node: The highest level node where the tree begins. (Ex: node A)
* Parent node: The node above the current nodes. (Ex: Node B is the parent of node E)
* Sibling node: Nodes that share the parent node. (Ex: Nodes F, G, and H are sibling nodes)
* Children node: The nodes below a parent node. (Ex: Node E is a child of node B)
* External node: The nodes at the end of the paths, not including the root. (Ex: Nodes K, L, F, G, M, I, and J are external nodes)
* Internal node: The opposite of external nodes. (Ex: Nodes A, B, C, D, E, and H are internal nodes)
* Depth: The number of nodes needed to reach a node from the root. (Ex: Node E has a depth of 2)
* Height: The number of layers a tree has. (Ex: This tree has a height of 4)
* Degree: The number of children a node has. (Ex: Node E has a degree of 2)
